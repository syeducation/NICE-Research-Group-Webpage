I am a cultural developmental psychologist with broad interests in identity and personality development among adolescents and emerging adults from diverse ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. Historically my work has focused on 1) how individuals’ identities, represented via personal narratives, interface with culturally-available master narratives, and 2) how youth integrate their multiple identities, with an emphasis on how ethnic identity intersects with other identity domains (e.g., gender, sexuality, education). In the last several years my research program has focused primarily on methods and practices used in psychology within the broad framework of open science and meta-psychology (research on how psychology operates as an academic discipline), especially in the context of developmental and ethnic minority psychology.
